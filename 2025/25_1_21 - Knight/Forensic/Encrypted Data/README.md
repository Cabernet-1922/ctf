There is a `.gpg` file under `/home/robot/Documents`. Read the gpg2john instruction here we will be able to decrypt the file and get the flag:
```bash
$ gpg2john .decrypt.txt.gpg > hash
$ john --format=gpg --wordlist=rockyou.txt hash

Loaded 1 password hash (gpg, OpenPGP / GnuPG Secret Key [32/64])
Cost 1 (s2k-count) is 58720256 for all loaded hashes
Cost 2 (hash algorithm [1:MD5 2:SHA1 3:RIPEMD160 8:SHA256 9:SHA384 10:SHA512 11:SHA224]) is 8 for all loaded hashes
Cost 3 (cipher algorithm [1:IDEA 2:3DES 3:CAST5 4:Blowfish 7:AES128 8:AES192 9:AES256 10:Twofish 11:Camellia128 12:Camellia192 13:Camellia256]) is 9 for all loaded hashes

letmein          (?)
```
This tells us the password is `letmein`, then decrypt the gpg file with password to get the flag:
```bash
$ gpg --decrypt .decrypt.txt.gpg

gpg: AES256.CFB encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
Y0U h4v3 D3crypt m3
```
flag: `KCTF{Y0U_h4v3_D3crypt_m3}`
