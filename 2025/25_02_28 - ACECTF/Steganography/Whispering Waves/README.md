With the wordlist, easy crack the zip file, put the audio file to audacity. Amplify the audio in case you dont see anything. The spectrogram as the cipher, turn that into binary data.
```enc
01000001 01000011 01000101 01000011 01010100 01000110 01111011 00110101 00110011 01100011 01110101 01110010 00110001 01101110 00110110 01110111 00110011 01100010 01111101 
```
Then turn the binary to ascii character will be the flag.

flag: `ACECTF{53cur1n6w3b}`
