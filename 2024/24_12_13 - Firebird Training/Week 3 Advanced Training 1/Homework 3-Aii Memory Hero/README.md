# Homework 3-Aii Memory Hero [100 points] (6 solves)

First, use IDA to export all the nodes as text file. Initially, there should be approximately 2â€“3 million routes, but after eliminating the dead-ends that will jump to "fail code", there will be still 280k routes. Also, one of the three origin points may be removed since it will always lead to a dead-end. Then all the potential routes/fake flags are input into fai_check.py, and the correct flag will eventually be generated after approximately five minutes of runtime.
```python

    temp = ""

            while "fail_code" not in text[pointer]:
                if re.findall("node[0-9]*",text[pointer]):
                    temp += re.findall("node[0-9]*",text[pointer])[0].replace("node","")+" "
                pointer += 1
